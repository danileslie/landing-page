# landing-page

this is my <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page">landing page project</a> from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">the odin project's</a> foundations curriculum. i was tasked with creating a landing page
from scratch based on a provided image.

# challenges
*   properly translating from static image to static web page
*   layout with flexbox

# areas for improvement
*   flexbox in general. i learned a lot about its general application but i need more work with setting up pages
*   understanding what flexbox is unable to do and working with it instead of against it
*   refactoring code. becomes a lot more difficult after leaving most of it to the end
